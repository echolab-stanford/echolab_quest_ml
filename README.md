# An EchoLab Machine Learning Quest

## Question 1: We live in the terminal

1. Fork this repo on your personal Github account. To make life easier, you should consider setting up an [SSH authentication on Gtihub][1].
2. `git clone` your fork to your local computer
3. Change the name on this README file above on your machine. Please get used to work on the terminal, try to use `nano`, `vim`, or `emacs` as a lot of the times VSCode won't be available to you.
4. Push your changes and verify your fork is correctly cloned on your machine.

Now, repeat this process in [Farmshare][2]. You can login using SSH: `<sunetid>@rice.stanford.edu`. You can see more help about Farmshare [here][2].


## Question 2: Image embeddings

Please folow the instructions in the LaTeX document and answer to the question in this Markdown file. Please create a Jupyter notebook for the visualizations/code. You can chose between separate things in modules in your code or add everything to the notebook. We prefer the latter.
